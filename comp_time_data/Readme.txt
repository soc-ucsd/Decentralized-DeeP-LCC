Solving time and modeling time of different methods with different disturbance dimensions are contained in time_solve.mat and time_form.mat which are two 1 by 4 cells. 

The format is:
time_form{1}: Modeling time for disturbance dimension 2. It is a 20 by 3 matrix with each column corresponding to 20 instances for a specific method. Column 1 is for Yalmip, column 2 is for Method I (Vertex), and column 3 is for Method II (Duality)
